			<h2>Activities &amp Leadership</h2>
			<h3>EntreCORPS</h3>
			<p>
				January 2015 - Present<br><br>
				Entrecorps is a student run consulting firm for startups and growing companies worldwide. Companies contact us for help in devising a business plan or consultation on plans they may already have in place. I worked on a plan to start a wearable device company that will work in conjunction with the Mayo Clinic.
			</p>

			<h3>Physics Student Advisory Board</h3>
			<p>
				March 2014 - March 2015<br><br>
				The board was in charge of helping improve the physics department through our feedback and suggestions from students. We also put on a downhill meeting towards the end of the year where faculty members come to answer student's questions and listen to their feedback on programs and classes.
			</p>

			<h3>President for the Illinois Association of Student Councils</h3>
			<p>
				May 2011 - May 2012<br><br>
				I held the position of president for the entire Illinois Student Council Association during my senior year of high school and it was one of the best experiences I had. I learned a lot about myself as a leader and how to work in a wide variety of teams. I also started a state wide service project titled Teens for Jeans that encouraged students all across the state to donate jeans to local shelters for teenagers in need which brought in thousands of pairs of jeans.
			</p>

			<h3>National Honors Society</h3>
			<p>
				2011 - Present<br><br>
				I served as secrtary of out local NHS chapter and during our anti bullying rally I invited a nationally acclaimed speaker to come to our school to kick off our campaign. This turned out to be a huge hit and helped to raise awareness school wide.
			</p>

			<h3>Appalachian Service Project</h3>
			<p>
				Summer of 2011 and 2012<br><br>
				I attended the ASP trip two summers in a row and it was an eye opening experience both times. We spent a week in areas of West Virginia and Kentucky  helping build improvements to people in need. It was an extremely moving experience that I hope I can get the opportunity to do again.

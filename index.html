					Originally when I was looking at my resume I hated that I couldn't explain things I've done in great detail or put my own spin on it. It was too formal but I couldn't really change the resume structure. So instead of just letting it go I decided to learn how to design a website. After messing around with prebuilt web designs I again ran in to the problem of not being able to do exactly what I wanted. So I then sought out how to write html/css code and from that sparked my interest in computer science and I went on to teach myself javascript and python and eventually earn a minor in it. I have tried to instill in everything I do an aversion to complacency. There is always a better way to do something and in the process you can learn a pretty useful skill.<br><br>

					I am a very curious person. If I encounter something I'm not familiar with or don't know in depth I will spend quite a bit of time researching it so in the case I encounter it again I could explain it to someone else. This has helped me excel in school most of my life but I have realized excelling in school isn't the end all be all. Working on projects outside of the classroom and taking education in to your own hands can, in some cases, be even more valuable. I try to learn something new everyday in a field I'm not familiar with even if I don't immediately see it's application. I have started a company with some friends in the hopes to get solar energy to those who couldn't normally afford it. These ventures outside of formal learning have been a recent endeavor of mine but have taught me more than a year of school ever could. I have learned to fail fast and fail often. I have learned how to research and deconstruct a problem that I know nothing about. I have grown beyond what I thought I was ever capable of.<br><br>

					I don't know where I'm headed in life and it seems every other week I have a new interest or goal. I don't see this as a case of indecisiveness but instead one of constant adventure. I'm always looking in to new things or coming up with some new way to revolutionize some area. Each of these excursions in to a different field has helped push me as a person and helped me to gain a new perspective I can take in to the next. I can easily say my interests will be different at the time you're reading this than they were when I wrote it, but I will be a better person as well. I plan to never stop learning and meeting new people to teach what I've learned to and learn from them their experiences. I'm aware I am far from knowing everything, but I am going to see just has close I can get.

					<p>
					During my senior year of college, a few friends and I started a solar company called Inpried by Nature. Our goal with the company is to get solar to those who can't afford it or who don't really know about it by renting their space for the use of producing solar energy. We are working to bring solar to a whole different area of the population that has traditionally been left out by making the process to get solar as easy as possible. We are also working to observe and map out an area for solar through apps as to expediate the process. We have gotten a little bit of funding and went through the interview process with world renown Y Combinator. My job for Inspired by Nature is Chief Technology Officer. I have been tasked with creating the wesbite, <a href="www.ibnhomes.com">www.ibnhomes.com</a>, and handling the software/technology that our company needs. I taught myself web programming and how to create a website from scratch, as well as turn an old computer in to a server to host our website. We built a tiered solar structure for use on rowhomes to maximize profit in the smaller areas. This structure was designed to be self cleaning/cooling from collecting rain water. This startup has forced me to learn a lot in a short amount of time and realize what it really takes to take a project like this to market.

					<div style="font-size: 35px; text-align: left; padding-left: 100px;">Wolfram Research Inc.</div>
					<p>
					I held two internships through Wolfram Research Inc. in different departments with the same responsibility. My job 	was technical documentation and I was in charge of taking the documentation for products writtten by engineers and turning it in to something that anyone could read and understand. I also handled contracts with external partners that required protocols in place for shared data and various other aspects of the company. I was chosen because I had a background in science but also my inetrests and knowledge about the non-technical. My time at Wolfram caused me to take up an interest in coding and caused me to teach myself the fundamentals of computer science and the pyhton programming language.

					<div style="font-size: 35px;text-align: left; padding-left: 100px;">Barnes & Noble</div>
					<p>
					I worked at Barnes & Noble through my first two years of college to help offset some of the costs of my education. I worked all around the store and developed various skills through my time there. I handled cashiering and customer service as well as handling technical questions and troubleshooting for the Nook Tablet/E-reader. I was able to handle explaining rather technical issues to customers that had no background in technology which helped lead to my internships at Wolfram Research.

				<p>
				I attended the University of Illinois for my undergrad and earned a Bachelors of Engineering in Physics with a concentration in Technology Entrepreneurship, and a minor in Computer Science. When I entered college I expected to go on and get my PhD and do research in physics, but after 4 years I now know that is far from my dream. I've grown to take an interest in many other fields from computer science to engineering law to entrepreneusrhsip. I enjoy how everything works together and working to create something directly for people. My interests are far reaching and I'm constantly finding new things to learn and I can owe that to the U of I. I have learned from some of the smartest professors in the world and studied along side some of the brightest minds in their field, and I have taken so much from all of these people.

				<p>
					The goal of the Physics Student Advisory Board was to be an intermediary between the students in the department and the faculty. We relayed concerns from the students to the faculty to try and make changes or enhance the curriculum. We held a townhall meeting twice a year where students could ask questions they've had and professors/faculty could answer these questions and also explain where the department is going in the near future.

				<div style="font-size: 30px; text-align: left; padding-left: 100px; text-decoration: underline;">Entrecorps</div>
				<p>
					In Entrecorps we were placed on teams where we worked with a startup which was sometimes in the area or was sometimes across the conutry. We would handle a problem they had and spend the semester researching and communicating with the client to try and formulate a solution. During my time on Entrecorps I helped a startup that was looking to make a testing facility for wearables and also Wolfram research where I had a prior intersnhip. This orginization helped to grow my interest in startups and be able to peek in to some of the problems they face.

					While I am a person who loves learning and is constantly trying to teach myself new things, I also have many hobbies and interests outside of that. I love to cook. <img src="Images/cooking-icon.png" style="float: right; width: 200px;"> I'm always trying to find new recipes and try different combinations of food and seeking out new restaurants. I enjoy reading a variety of books. I read everything from textbooks on varying subjects to nonfiction and fiction books as well. <img src="Images/books.png" style="float: left; width: 150px; padding-right: 20px;">I love to read science fiction and it has always intrigued me that every few years the stuff of science fiction becomes a reality. I have surrounded myself with friends that can have deep conversations and challenge my ideas. I enjoy being outdoors going on hikes or playing all kinds of different sports. <img src="Images/active-icon.png" style="float: right; width: 150px;">I've played soccer and golf nearly all my life and I'm constantly trying to find new ways to be active. I've tried my best to make myself a well rounded person where I can work hard and concentrate on my current project, but I can enjoy those around me and find new friends and new interests. Knowing your field and skills is great but being able to accept new experiences is just as important.

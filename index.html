			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<img class="me" src="me.jpg">

			<p>    There is only so much you can fit on a resume, and it is always so one dimensional. This about me section won't capture the complete person I am, but it will do better than a resume could. As it states I am an undergraduate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I will graduate here with a degree in Engineering Physics, but I have learned much more than just equations and physics concepts. The way I look at the world and tackle problems is leaps and bounds different than when I came in here as a Freshman. I have learned creative ways to break problems down and observe them in ways that a lot of degrees don't teach. I have learned how to teach myself abstract concepts in varying areas in order to complete assignments, which I have taken even further to teach myself concepts in varying from business models to computer science. The fundamentals I have been taught and the experience I've gained is invaluable.
			</p>



			<p>    I thought when I entered this degree that I was going to go on to do research in academia, but after a few research groups I realized that was not what I wanted to do with my life. I loved solving problems, but not in a lab. I loved solving problems for people out in the real world. I was intrigued by companies like Google, Facebook, and other technology companies that looked at really simple problems and created entire industries around them. It fascinated me what they could do starting out with teams of a few people and growing in to some of the world's largest companies. I realized I didn't want to work for a university, but I instead wanted to work for one of these companies that were truly affecting the world and how people function at fundamental level.
			</p>

			<p>    I love learning. I am constantly checking news sites, looking up various unfamiliar words or things I hear, or teaching myself a new skill or area. I have recently been teaching myself concepts pertaining to computer science like different programming languages and operating system fundamentals. Before that I was teaching myself the concepts behind the stock market like options, futures, and the Black-Scholes equation. I feel like I can never truly know enough, and I'm working to learn something about everything.

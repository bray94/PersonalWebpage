			<h2>Experience</h2>
			<h3>Wolfram Research Inc.</h3>
			<p>
				Intern<br>May2014-Present
			</p>

			<p>
				I worked at Wolfram Research for the last two summers and during the school year on technical documentation. I worked in two departments, Global Technical Operations and Web Systems Engineering, gathering and consolidating documentation on both technical and non-technical subjects. I gained knowledge on things regarding business continuity, data acquisition, programming large applications, and various other areas that pertain to many areas of a big technology company. Prior to Wolfram Research I hadn't had any programming experience but it helped to spark an interest in computer science which has turned into the pursuit of a computer science minor.

			<h3>Barnes and Noble</h3>
			<p>
				Bookseller<br>October 2012 - August 2014
			</p>

			<p>
				I worked at Barnes and Noble through my first two years of college to help get money for school and gain experience in customer service. While I was in charge of shelving books and working the cash register, I also gained insight on how to deal with customers and even worked on technical support for the Nook reader and tablet both in store and on the phone for customers. Working at Barnes and Noble didn't necessarily pertain to my engineering career, but it helped to teach me responsibility and skills I may not have found elsewhere.
